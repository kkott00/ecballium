        <h2>Why Use It</h3>

<h4>Why BDD</h4>

<p>
My boss sometime asked me to explain what our test actually covered. 
To response to that I tried to open my test files with beatiful Python code and discovered that I also didn't remember 
what exactly my test code did.
Comments also didn't help cause developers and comments it is really sad story. 
To resolve this problem I decided to describe test in human readable form. 
<a href="http://lettuce.it">Lettuce</a> helped me in that.
It also gave me possibilty to describe system behavior before any feature was implemented.
Together with that I got power tool to exchange my ideas with collegues. 
And my test report became brilliant cause they had clean step description.
</p>

<h4>Why not other frameworks</h4>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/wiki">Jasmine...</a><br>
 is great and successful attempt to implement BDD concept but it keep behavior description and step implementation mixed in single file.
 But just Jasmine inspired me to launch tests in browser.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://seleniumhq.org/">SeleniumHQ...</a><br>
Selenium is also usefull thing to test webapp but it allways has issues with different browsers. 
It also imposible to handle callback from JS code back to test code managed by Selenium.
As a result I wrote JS side testbot which waited for callbacks and make complex client-side actions.
</p>

<h4>It can immitate user interactions</h4>
<p>
Standard Ecballium library can help to make screencast with demo of your webapp. There are some helpers there:<br>
- fake mouse pointer, which autmatically moves to focused element<br>
- context messenger for leaving messages close to mouse pointer<br>
- highlighted areas with text description and comments<br>
- legacy mouse event creator to immitate complex mouse interactions
